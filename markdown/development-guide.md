# Development Guide

The intent behind the Reactium Framework is to get you quickly creating React components and applications.
With that in mind, we geared the tooling towards automation and ease of use.

Before reading the rest of this guide, grab the [Atomic Reactor CLI](https://github.com/Atomic-Reactor/CLI) it will make creating components, styles, and toolkit elements extremely easy.

No, seriously... go get the CLI:

```
$ npm i -g @atomic-reactor/cli
```

## Zero Day Install

Instead of cloning the main Reactium repo, you can install via the ARCLI:

```
$ cd YOUR_PROJECT
$ arcli reactium install
$ npm install
$ npm run local
```

## Components

There are 3 types of components you can create:

-   [Functional Components](#functional-components)
-   [Class Components](#class-components)
-   [Redux Class Components](#redux-class-components)

### Functional Components

Create a Functional Component if your component will not need to worry about application state or events. Functional components accept a single `props` argument and should be very clear and concise in their make-up.

```js
export default (props) => {
    return (
        <div>
          <h1>Hey {props.name}!</h1>
        </div>;
    );
}
```

> The functional style components are nice and simple for purely presentational pieces.

### Class Components

Create a Class Component if your component will need the React Life Cycle Methods or internal state management.

```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';

export default class Hello extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = Object.assign({}, this.props});
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    console.log("Mounted Hello Component");
  }

  render() {
    return (
        <div>
          <h1>Hey {this.state.name}!</h1>
        </div>
    );
  }
}

Hello.defaultProps = {
  name: "Bob"
};
```

### Redux Class Components

Create a Redux Class Component if your component will need to interact with the application state.
Redux Class Components work just like Class Components accept you will need to map state to properties and map dispatchers to actions via the [react-redux](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux/blob/master/docs/api.md#connectmapstatetoprops-mapdispatchtoprops-mergeprops-options) `connect` method.

index.js (redux wrapper):

```javascript
import Test from './Test';
import { connect } from 'react-redux';
import deps from 'dependencies';

// Map state to properties
const mapStateToProps = (state, props) => Object.assign({}, state.Test, props);

// Map dispatchers to actions
const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch, props) => ({
    test: {
        click: () => dispatch(deps().actions.Test.click()),
    },
});

export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(Test);
```

Test.js:

```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';

export default class Test extends Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);

        this.state = {
            msg: this.props.message,
            count: this.props.count,
        };
    }

    componentDidUpdate(prevProps) {
        const newState = {};
        const { count: prevCount, msg: prevMsg } = prevProps;
        const { count: currCount, msg: currMsg } = this.props;

        if (prevCount !== currCount) {
            newState.count = currCount;
        }

        if (prevMsg !== currMsg) {
            newState.msg = currMsg;
        }

        if (Object.keys(newState).length > 0) {
            this.setState(newState);
        }
    }

    // Use the above mapped click dispatcher on button click
    onClick() {
        this.props.test.click();
    }

    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                <div>{this.state.msg}</div>
                <button type='button' onClick={this.onClick.bind(this)}>
                    Click Me
                </button>
                <div>{this.state.count || 0}</div>
            </div>
        );
    }
}
```

## Component Architecture

Reactium component architecture is pretty simple when it comes to a function or class component.

1.  Create the component domain in the `~/src/app/components` directory.
2.  Create an `index.js` file with your component code.

The following domain artifacts can be used/found withing your component domain to utilize Reactium's Domain Driven component architecture:

| File                                                                                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

> Don't worry, there's a CLI command that automates component creation.
> `$ arcli component -h`

> **Note:** In some cases you may need to restart the watch after creating a new component with state, reducers, actions, actionTypes, etc.

### The actions.js File

Reactium aggregates all `action.js` files into the `actions` property of the `dependencies` module default export.

A typical `actions.js` file may look like this:

```javascript
import deps from 'dependencies';

export default {
    mount: params => dispatch => {
        dispatch({ type: deps().actionTypes.TEST_MOUNT, data: params });
    },

    click: () => dispatch => {
        dispatch({ type: deps().actionTypes.TEST_CLICK });
    },
};
```

To access the actions simply import the dependencies:

```javascript
import deps from 'dependencies';
```

Then use an action by targeting the component domain that created the action:

```javascript
//...
deps().actions.Test.mount({ some: 'params' });
```

### The actionTypes.js File

Reactium aggregates all `actionTypes.js` into the `actionTypes` property of the `dependencies` module default export.

A typical `actionTypes.js` file may look like this:

```javascript
export default {
    TEST_MOUNT: 'TEST_MOUNT',
    TEST_CLICK: 'TEST_CLICK',
};
```

To access the actionTypes, import them into your component. Not that unlike other domain dependencies, actionTypes are flattened together in `deps().actionTypes` with no domain.:

```javascript
import deps from 'dependencies';
```

Usage:

```javascript
//...
dispatch({ type: deps().actionTypes.TEST_MOUNT, data: data });
```

### The index.js File

See [Redux Class Components](https://github.com/Atomic-Reactor/Reactium#redux-class-components).

### The reducers.js File

Reactium aggregates all `reducers.js` files into the Redux store using the [react-redux](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux/tree/master/docs) `combineReducers` method.

A typical `reducers.js` file may look like this:

```javascript
import deps from 'dependencies';

export default (state = {}, action) => {
    let newState;

    switch (action.type) {
        case deps().actionTypes.TEST_MOUNT:
            newState = Object.assign({}, state, { ...action.data });
            return newState;
            break;

        case deps().actionTypes.TEST_CLICK:
            let count = state.count || 0;
            newState = Object.assign({}, state, { count: count + 1 });
            return newState;
            break;

        default:
            return state;
    }
};
```

### The route.js File

Reactium aggregates all `route.js` files into a list of routes used to render React Router [`<Route />` components](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/Route) and observed by the the Reactium `RouteObserver` component.

A route can have any property that is supported by [`<Route />`](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/Route) (e.g. `path`, `exact`, `strict`, `location`, `component`, `render`, and `children`).

A typical `route.js` file in `MyComponent` may look like this:

```javascript
// Import your component
import MyComponent from './index';

// Import the aggregated actions (optional)
import deps from 'dependencies';

export default {
    // Make this higher number to have route evaluated later (default 0)
    order: 0,

    // Route pattern that should route to
    path: '/my-component/:paramA/:paramB',

    // Should the Route be exact?
    exact: true,

    // the component to load for this route
    component: MyComponent,

    // (optional) a Redux thunk action to load data for this component
    load: params => deps().actions.MyComponent.mount(params),
};
```

In addition to [`<Route />`](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/Route) properties, you can also provide a [Redux thunk](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk) action function to the `load` property. The Reactium `RouteObserver` component will automatically dispatch your `load` thunk, passing along route parameters. Use this for asynchronous loading of data on observed route changes.

#### Multi-route Modules

You can also support multiple routes for a module, in one of two methods:

-   provide multiple paths for a single route

```javascript
import MyComponent from './index';

export default {
    // both of these will resolve to this component
    path: ['/first/path', '/second/path'],
    exact: true,
    component: MyComponent,
};
```

-   provide multiple route objects

```javascript
import MyComponent from './index';
import deps from 'dependencies';

// export an array of routes
export default [
    {
        order: 1,
        path: '/base-route',
        exact: true,
        component: MyComponent,
        load: params => deps().actions.MyComponent(params),
    },
    {
        order: 0,
        path: '/base-route/:param',
        exact: true,
        component: MyComponent,
        load: params => deps().actions.MyComponent(params),
    },
];
```

### The services.js File

Reactium aggregates all `services.js` files into the `services` property of the `dependencies` module default export.

A typical `services.js` file may look like this:

```javascript
import axios from 'axios';
import { restHeaders } from 'dependencies';

const restAPI = 'http://demo3914762.mockable.io';

const fetchHello = () => {
    let hdr = restHeaders();
    return axios
        .get(`${restAPI}/hello`, { headers: hdr })
        .then(({ data }) => data);
};

const fetchGoodBye = () => {
    let hdr = restHeaders();
    return axios
        .get(`${restAPI}/goodbye`, { headers: hdr })
        .then(({ data }) => data);
};

export default {
    fetchHello,
    fetchGoodBye,
};
```

In your actions.js file you would do something like:

```javascript
import deps from 'dependencies';

export default {
    mount: params => dispatch => {
        deps()
            .services.Test.fetchHello()
            .then(data => {
                dispatch({
                    type: deps().actionTypes.TEST_MOUNT,
                    payload: data,
                });
            });
    },
};
```

> Reactium uses [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) to make XMLHttpRequests from the browser. You can swap that out with whatever you want.

To access the services, import them into your component:

```javascript
import deps from 'dependencies';
```

Usage:

```javascript
///...
deps()
    .services.Test.fetchHello()
    .then(result => {
        // Do something with the result
    });
```

### The state.js File

Reactium aggregates all `state.js` files into the Redux `store` for the application.

A typical `state.js` file may look like this:

```javascript
export default {
    some: 'value',
    another: 1,
};
```

To persist the domain state to local storage for insertion as initial state on hard reload, add a `persist` property:

```javascript
export default {
    some: 'value',
    another: 1,

    // See https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux-local-persist for additional
    // configuration options.
    persist: true,
};
```

## Creating Components

1.  Before creating a component, grab the [Atomic Reactor CLI](https://github.com/Atomic-Reactor/CLI):

```
$ npm i -g @atomic-reactor/cli
```

2.  Change directory into your project:

```
$ cd /MyAwesome/Project
```

3.  Input the new component command:

```
$ arcli component
```

Flags:

```
-r, --redux-all [reduxAll]       Include all Redux files.
-n, --name [name]                Component name.
-d, --destination [destination]  Component parent directory.
-o, --overwrite [overwrite]      Overwrite existing component.
-t, --type [type]                Component type: class | functional.
--redux [redux]                  Create Redux Class component.
--actions [actions]              Include Redux actions.js file.
--actionTypes [actionTypes]      Include Redux actionTypes.js file.
--reducers [reducers]            Include Redux reducers.js file.
--route [route]                  Include route.js file.
--plugin [plugin]                Include plugin.js file.
--services [services]            Include services.js file.
--stylesheet [stylesheet]        Include style.scss file.
-h, --help                       Output usage information
```

4.  Follow the prompts

## Using Components

Now that you've created your first component, it's time to use it.
Open the `~/src/index.html` file and add the component to the layout using the custom element `<Component />`.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html class="no-js" lang="">
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8" />
        <meta http-equiv="x-ua-compatible" content="ie=edge" />
        <title>Reactium</title>
        <meta
            name="description"
            content="A framework for creating React + Redux apps using the domain driven design (DDD) paradigm."
        />
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/style/style.css" />
    </head>
    <body>
        <Component type="Fubar"></Component>
        <script src="/assets/js/vendors.js"></script>
        <script src="/assets/js/main.js"></script>
    </body>
</html>
```

> Alternatively, you can just start using the component in your app like you would any other React component.

Reactium will now scan your markup for the `<Component />` tags and bind the specified `type` to the element.
You can pass initial state to the component via attributes but that's not necessary if you're using Redux for state management.

The component can be located in either the `src/components` directory or the `src/components/common-ui` directory, or one of the built-in core components.

## Using SPA

For Single-Page Applications, simply add `<div id="router"></div>` to your html, with or in place of `<Component />` tags. You will need to serve the same html page for all URLs your SPA supports. See only

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html class="no-js" lang="">
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8" />
        <meta http-equiv="x-ua-compatible" content="ie=edge" />
        <title>Reactium</title>
        <meta
            name="description"
            content="A framework for creating React + Redux apps using the domain driven design (DDD) paradigm."
        />
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/style/style.css" />
    </head>
    <body>
        <div id="router"></div>
        <script src="/assets/js/vendors.js"></script>
        <script src="/assets/js/main.js"></script>
    </body>
</html>
```

# Deployment

To run the production build:

```
$ npm run build
```

This will build both the front-end assets (in _public_), as well as the node/express the production ready files (in _build_).

```
public
└── assets
    ├── fonts
    ├── images
    ├── js
    └── style
```

To run the production server in front-end only mode, either deploy the _public_ assets to your server and add them to your backend templates (with appropriate bindings)

```html
<html>
    <head>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/style/style.css" />
    </head>
    <body>
        <!-- Automatically bind MyComponent -->
        <Component type="MyComponent"></Component>

        <!-- For Single-Page Application, the top-level component binding -->
        <div id="router"></div>

        <script src="/assets/js/vendors.js"></script>
        <script src="/assets/js/main.js"></script>
    </body>
</html>
```

Deploy the entire project directory if you wish to run the node/express server to serve either your front-end only application, or the application with server-side rendering.

## Node Server

By default, running the server with `npm start` will start the server on port 3030 in front-end rendering mode.

Reactium uses the combination of [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/), [Webpack 3](https://webpack.js.org/), & [Browsersync](https://browsersync.io/) to build and run the development environment.

> You might ask: Why not use just Webpack or just Gulp?

We identified 4 major requirements for our workflow:

1.  [Bundling and transpiling Javascript](https://github.com/Atomic-Reactor/Reactium/blob/master/readme.md#bundling-and-transpiling-javascript).
2.  [Moving assets from one location to another](https://github.com/Atomic-Reactor/Reactium/blob/master/readme.md#moving-assets).
3.  [Sass compilation and optimization](https://github.com/Atomic-Reactor/Reactium/blob/master/readme.md#sass-compilation-and-optimization).
4.  [Hot reload of the development environment](https://github.com/Atomic-Reactor/Reactium/blob/master/readme.md#hot-reloading).

#### Bundling and Transpiling Javascript

Without a doubt we felt that Webpack was the best solution for this requirement. The deciding factor was Webpack's dependency handling and tree shaking (removing unused modules).

#### Moving Assets

Gulp provides a frictionless and very simple pattern for moving assets. The deciding factor was Gulp's ability to transport multiple file types to multiple destinations with very little setup or additional libraries or configuration.

#### Sass Compilation and Optimization

Gulp's ability to compile Sass is pretty straight forward and doesn't require a lot of configuration. We found that with Webpack, this wasn't obviously clear and took a lot of configuration to get the right set up. Webpack also restricts the delivery of the compiled style sheet to a single destination, making it hard to save the file to multiple directories if needed.

#### Hot Reloading

Browsersync offers a large variety of simple configurations that allows you to serve the development environment locally. The deciding factor was Browsersync's ability to serve from a proxy instead of the application directory. This could come in handy if you need to run a node instance as well as your application within your development environment.
